  abstract = {Wet deposition of nitrogen (N) occurs in oxidized (nitrate) and reduced (ammonium) forms. Whether one form drives vegetation change more than the other is widely debated, as field evidence has been lacking. We are manipulating N form in wet deposition to an ombrotrophic bog, Whim (Scottish Borders), and here report nine years of results. Ammonium and nitrate were provided in rainwater spray as NH4Cl or NaNO3 at 8, 24 or 56~kg~N~ha-1~yr-1, plus a rainwater only control, via an automated system coupled to site meteorology. Detrimental N effects were observed in sensitive nonvascular plant species, with higher cumulative N loads leading to more damage at lower annual doses. Cover responses to N addition, both in relation to form and dose, were species specific and mostly dependent on N dose. Some species were generally indifferent to N form and dose, while others were dose sensitive. Calluna vulgaris showed a preference for higher N doses as ammonium N and Hypnum jutlandicum for nitrate N. However, after 9~years, the magnitude of change from wet deposited N on overall species cover is small, indicating only a slow decline in key species. Nitrogen treatment effects on soil N availability were likewise small and rarely correlated with species cover. Ammonium caused most N accumulation and damage to sensitive species at lower N loads, but toxic effects also occurred with nitrate. However, because different species respond differently to N form, setting of ecosystem level critical loads by N form is challenging. We recommend implementing the lowest value of the critical load range where communities include sensitive nonvascular plants and where ammonium dominates wet deposition chemistry. In the context of parallel assessment at the same site, N treatments for wet deposition showed overall much smaller effects than corresponding inputs of dry deposition as ammonia.},

  volume = {1},
  doi = {10.1100/tsw.2001.82},
  abstract = {Numerous passive samplers based on the `Palmes-tube' have been developed for ambient air monitoring. In each case, the diffusion path length and/or crosssectional area are modified to achieve the desired sampling rate. `Tube-type' samplers are low sensitivity samplers suitable for long-term monitoring, whereas the `badge-type' samplers have faster sampling rates suited to short-term monitoring. In the U.K., diffusion tubes are widely used for monitoring nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ammonia (NH3). The open-ended diffusion tubes are prone to positive bias caused by incursion of wind eddies, leading to a shortening of the diffusion path. By using a porous membrane at the inlet, wind incursion is prevented, but an additional diffusion resistance is imposed and it is necessary to calibrate the tubes against a reference method to obtain an effective sampling rate. For NO2 sampling, positive bias also arises from the reaction of NO with O3 within the sampler. The interference from the chemical reaction is severe close to NO sources, with errors up to 30\% for curbside locations when using the `tubetype' sampler. In rural areas, where NO concentrations are small relative to NO2, these errors are small. In some implementations, there is also a negative bias over long sampling periods caused by the degradation of trapped NO2. The low sampling rates of diffusion tubes make them too uncertain for use at background NH3 concentrations (\&\#x3C;1 $\mu$g NH3 m-3) where they significantly overestimate concentrations. Badge-type samplers such as the `Willems badge' samplers permit accurate sampling at low ambient NH3 concentrations, but suffer from saturation at high concentrations and sensitivity to wind speed. A passive sampler optimised for monthly measurements of NH3 is reported here, together with its application in the U.K. National Ammonia Monitoring Network.},

To quantify the effects of NH3 inputs to moorland vegetation growing on a bog at a field scale, a field release NH3 fumigation system was established at Whim Moss (Scottish Borders) in 2002. Gaseous NH3 from a line source was released along of a 60 m transect, when meteorological conditions (wind speed $>$2.5 m s-1 and wind direction in the sector 180\textendash{}215$^\circ$) were met, thereby providing a profile of decreasing NH3 concentration with distance from the source. In a complementary study, using a NH3 flux chamber system, the relationships between NH3 concentrations and cuticular resistances were quantified for a range of NH3 concentrations and micrometeorological conditions for moorland vegetation. Cuticular resistances increased with NH3 concentration from 11 s m-1 at 3.0 $\mu$g m-3 to 30 s m-1 at 30 $\mu$g m-3. The NH3 concentration data and the concentration-dependent canopy resistance are used to calculate NH3 deposition taking into account leaf surface wetness. The implications of using an NH3 concentration-dependent cuticular resistance and the importance for refining critical loads are discussed.},

  abstract = {Measurements of the concentrations of nitrogen compounds in air and precipitation in the UK have been made since the mid-19th century, but no networks operating to common protocols and having traceable analytical procedures were established until the 1950s. From 1986 onwards, a high-quality network of sampling stations for precipitation chemistry was established across the UK. In the following decade, monitoring networks provided measurement of NO2, NH3, HNO3 and a satisfactory understanding of the dry deposition process for these gases allowed dry deposition to be quantified. Maps of N deposition for oxidized and reduced compounds at a spatial scale of 5 km \texttimes{} 5 km are available from 1986 to 2000. Between 1950 and 1985, the more limited measurements, beginning with those of the European Air Chemistry Network (EACN) provide a reasonable basis to estimate wet deposition of NO 3 - -N and NH 4 + -N. For the first half of the century, estimates of deposition were scaled with emissions assuming a constant relationship between emission and deposition for each of the components of the wet and dry deposition budget at the country scale. Emissions of oxidized N, which dominated total nitrogen emissions throughout the century, increased from 312 kt N annually in 1900 to a peak of 787 kt for the decade 1980\textendash{}1990 and then declined to 460 kt in 2000. Emissions of reduced N, largely from coal combustion were about 168 kt N in 1900, increasing to a peak of 263 kt N in 2000 and by now dominated by agricultural sources. Reduced N dominated the deposition budget at the country scale, increasing from 163 kt N in 1900 to 211 kt N in 2000, while deposition of oxidized N was 66 kt N in 1900 and 191 kt N in 2000. Over the century, 68 Mt (Tg) of fixed N was emitted within the UK, 78\% as NO x , while 29 Mt of nitrogen was deposited (43\% of emissions), equivalent to 1.2 t N ha-1, on average, with 60\% in the reduced form. Deposition to semi-natural ecosystems is approximately 15 Tg N, equivalent to between 1 and 5 t N ha-1, over the century and appears to be accumulating in soil. The N deposition over the century is similar in magnitude to the total soil N inventory in surface horizons.},

This paper describes an automated field exposure system (30 km S. of Edinburgh, Scotland) for treating ombrotrophic bog vegetation with fine droplets of oxidised N (NaNO3) and reduced N (NH4Cl). Whim Moss exists in an area of low ambient N deposition (ca. 8 kg N ha-1 y-1), the sources and quantification of which are described. The wet N treatment system is run continuously, and is controlled/activated by wind speed and rainfall to provide a unique simulation of ``real worl'' treatment patterns (no rain=no treatment). Simulated precipitation is supplied at ionic concentrations below 4 mM in rainwater collected on site. Treatments provide a replicated dose response to 16, 32 and 64 kg N ha-1 y-1 adjusted for ambient deposition (8 kg N ha-1 y-1). The 16 and 64 kg N ha-1 y-1 are duplicated with a P+K supplement.

  abstract = {1. The effects of increased nitrogen or phosphorus supply on the productivity of Sphagnum-dominated ombrotrophic bogs in northern and southern Sweden were studied. Atmospheric nitrogen deposition in southern Sweden (high-N site) exceeds that in northern Sweden (low-N site) by about tenfold. 2. Vertical height growth of the Sphagnum carpet was measured by the cranked-wire method. Length growth of individuals was measured by autoradiography after labelling with 14CO2. The results of both methods were significantly correlated, but the cranked-wire data were systematically lower. 3. Productivity of Sphagnum at the low-N site increased almost fourfold after additional nitrogen supply (4 g N m-2 year-1), but no increase was found after additional phosphorus supply (0.4 g P m-2 year-1). At the high-N site, phosphorus supply caused an almost threefold productivity increase, but nitrogen supply did not result in any productivity increase. Thus, in an area with a high atmospheric nitrogen supply, plant productivity is P-limited instead of N-limited. 4. At an intermediate nitrogen supply (2 g N m-2 year-1) the recovery of the supplied nitrogen in the Sphagnum carpet was not different for both sites (60\% and 69\%, respectively). However, at a high nitrogen supply (4 g N m-2 year-1) nitrogen recovery at the low-N site significantly exceeded that at the high-N site (73\% and 47\%, respectively). At the low-N site, the supplied phosphorus was not recovered, but at the high-N site the phosphorus recovery was 85\% (intermediate phosphorus supply) and 100\% (high phosphorus supply), respectively. 5. It is suggested that a high atmospheric nitrogen supply may affect the carbon balance of ombrotrophic bogs, because productivity is under these circumstances not N-limited, but decomposition is probably increased by high loads of nitrogen. In the end, this may turn these C-accumulating systems into C-emitting systems.},

This allows the method to focus on the time-dependent treatment effects. The principal component is plotted against time, yielding a principal response curve of the community for each treatment. The PRC method distills the complexity of time-dependent, community-level effects of pollutants into a graphic form that can be appreciated more readily than the results of other currently available multivariate techniques. The PRC method also enables a quantitative interpretation of effects towards the species level.},

  abstract = {Pristine bogs, peatlands in which vegetation is exclusively fed by rainwater (ombrotrophic), typically have a low atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen (N) ($<$0.5kgha-1y-1). An important additional N source is N2 fixation by symbiotic microorganisms (diazotrophs) in peat and mosses. Although the effects of increased total airborne N by anthropogenic emissions on bog vegetation are well documented, the important question remains how different N forms (ammonium, NH4+, versus nitrate, NO3-) affect N cycling, as their relative contribution to the total load strongly varies among regions globally. Here, we studied the effects of 11years of experimentally increased deposition (32 versus 8kgNha-1y-1) of either NH4+ or NO3- on N accumulation in three moss and one lichen species (Sphagnum capillifolium, S. papillosum, Pleurozium schreberi and Cladonia portentosa), N2 fixation rates of their symbionts, and potential N losses to peat soil and atmosphere, in a bog in Scotland. Increased input of both N forms led to 15\textendash{}90\% increase in N content for all moss species, without affecting their cover. The keystone species S. capillifolium showed 4 times higher N allocation into free amino acids, indicating N stress, but only in response to increased NH4+. In contrast, NO3- addition resulted in enhanced peat N mineralization linked to microbial NO3- reduction, increasing soil pH, N concentrations and N losses via denitrification. Unexpectedly, increased deposition from 8 to 32kgha-1y-1 in both N forms did not affect N2 fixation rates for any of the moss species and corresponded to an additional input of 5kgNha-1y-1 with a 100\% S. capillifolium cover. Since both N forms clearly show differential effects on living Sphagnum and biogeochemical processes in the underlying peat, N form should be included in the assessment of the effects of N pollution on peatlands.},

  abstract = {Mires (bogs and fens) are nutrient-limited peatland ecosystems, the vegetation of which is especially sensitive to nitrogen deposition and climate change. The role of mires in the global carbon cycle, and the delivery of different ecosystem services can be considerably altered by changes in the vegetation, which has a strong impact on peat-formation and hydrology. Mire ecosystems are commonly open with limited canopy cover but both nitrogen deposition and increased temperatures may increase the woody vegetation component. It has been predicted that such an increase in tree cover and the associated effects on light and water regimes would cause a positive feed-back loop with respect to the ground vegetation. None of these effects, however, have so far been confirmed in large-scale spatiotemporal studies. Here we analyzed data pertaining to mire vegetation from the Swedish National Forest Inventory collected from permanent sample plots over a period of 20 yr along a latitudinal gradient covering 14 degrees. We hypothesized that the changes would be larger in the southern parts as a result of higher nitrogen deposition and warmer climate. Our results showed an increase in woody vegetation with increases in most ericaceous dwarf-shrubs and in the basal area of trees. These changes were, in contrast to our expectations, evenly distributed over most of the latitudinal gradient. While nitrogen deposition is elevated in the south, the increase in temperatures during recent decades has been larger in the north. Hence, we suggest that different processes in the north and south have produced similar vegetation changes along the latitudinal gradient. There was, however, a sharp increase in compositional change at high deposition, indicating a threshold effect in the response. Instead of a positive feed-back loop caused by the tree layer, an increase in canopy cover reduced the changes in composition of the ground vegetation, whereas a decrease in canopy cover lead to larger changes. Increased natural disturbances of the tree layer due to, for example, pathogens or climate is a predicted outcome of climate change. Hence, these results may have important implications for predictions of long-term effects of increased temperature on peatland vegetation.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2015.01.029},
  abstract = {Previous studies have shown that the floristic composition of northern peatlands provides important information regarding ecosystem processes and their responses to environmental change. Remote sensing is the most expeditious method of obtaining floristic information at landscape and regional scales, but the spatial complexity of many northern peatlands and the spectral similarity of a number of peatland vegetation species is such that the success of traditional methods of vegetation classification is often limited. Here, we assessed whether ordination and regression analyses may be a useful alternative method for mapping peatland plant communities from remote sensing data. We used isometric feature mapping (Isomap) to describe the community structure of the peatland vegetation and related the identified continuous floristic gradients to hyperspectral imagery (AEA Eagle) using partial least squares regression (PLSR). We performed the same analysis at two hierarchical levels of species aggregation in order to map continuous gradients in the composition of both species and plant functional types (PFTs), the latter of which is the most widely used level of aggregation in northern ecosystems. Isomap was able to transfer 82\% and more than 96\% of the observed ground-based observations to the ordination space for plots characterised by species and PFT; respectively. The modelled floristic gradients showed good agreement with ground-based species and PFT observations although the strength of the agreement was proportional to the amount of floristic variation explained by each ordination axis (r(val)(2) = 0.74, 0.45 and 030 for the first three ordination axes and r(val)(2) = 0.68 and 0.66 for the first two ordination axes; for species and PFT floristic gradients respectively). We also found that how a PVC is defined has an important influence on the success with which it can be mapped. The resultant mapped floristic gradients enabled visualisation of homogeneous vegetation stands, heterogeneous mixtures of different key species and PFTs, and the presence of continuous and abrupt floristic transitions, without the need for unique spectral signatures or the collection of data characterising ancillary environmental variables.

  abstract = {Ombrotrophic bog peatlands are nutrient-deficient systems and important carbon (C) sinks yet the stoichiometry of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), essential for plant growth and decomposition, has rarely been studied. We investigated the seasonal variation in C, N, P, and K concentrations and their stoichiometric ratios in photosynthetically active tissues of 14 species belonging to five plant functional types (PFTs) (mosses, deciduous trees/shrubs, evergreen shrubs, graminoids, and forb) at Mer Bleue bog, an ombrotrophic peatland in eastern Ontario, Canada. Although we observed variations in stoichiometry among PFTs at peak growing season, there was convergence of C:N:P:K to an average mass ratio of 445:14:1:9, indicating N and P co-limitation. Nitrogen, P, and K concentrations and stoichiometric ratios showed little seasonal variation in mosses, evergreens, and graminoids, but in forb and deciduous species were the largest in spring and decreased throughout the growing season. Variations in nutrient concentrations and stoichiometric ratios among PFTs were greater than seasonal variation within PFTs. Plants exhibit N and P co-limitation and adapt to extremely low nutrient availability by maintaining small nutrient concentrations in photosynthetically active tissues, especially for evergreen shrubs and Sphagnum mosses. Despite strong seasonal variations in nutrient availabilities, few species show strong seasonal variation in nutrient concentrations, suggesting a strong stoichiometric homeostasis at Mer Bleue bog.},

  abstract = {A significant challenge in the prediction of climate change impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity is quantifying the sources of uncertainty that emerge within and between different models. Statistical species niche models have grown in popularity, yet no single best technique has been identified reflecting differing performance in different situations. Our aim was to quantify uncertainties associated with the application of 2 complimentary modelling techniques. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) and generalised additive mixed models (GAMM) were used to model the realised niche of ombrotrophic Sphagnum species in British peatlands. These models were then used to predict changes in Sphagnum cover between 2020 and 2050 based on projections of climate change and atmospheric deposition of nitrogen and sulphur. Over 90\% of the variation in the GLMM predictions was due to niche model parameter uncertainty, dropping to 14\% for the GAMM. After having covaried out other factors, average variation in predicted values of Sphagnum cover across UK peatlands was the next largest source of variation (8\% for the GLMM and 86\% for the GAMM). The better performance of the GAMM needs to be weighed against its tendency to overfit the training data. While our niche models are only a first approximation, we used them to undertake a preliminary evaluation of the relative importance of climate change and nitrogen and sulphur deposition and the geographic locations of the largest expected changes in Sphagnum cover. Predicted changes in cover were all small (generally $<$1\% in an average 4 m(2) unit area) but also highly uncertain. Peatlands expected to be most affected by climate change in combination with atmospheric pollution were Dartmoor, Brecon Beacons and the western Lake District.},

In a greenhouse, the plants were grown in monocultures and mixtures at four nutrient treatments: control, high N, high P, and high N + P. The results show that the ericoids responded more strongly to the nutrient treatments than the graminoids. The dwarf shrubs showed higher growth rates and reduced root:shoot ratio at high N + P supply. When grown in mixture the ericoids increased their growth, while graminoids decreased in biomass or showed signs of nutrient limitation compared to their monoculture plants. This suggests that under increased nutrient availability, bogs are more likely to turn into dwarf shrub dominated ecosystems and not grassland.},

Little is known about species interactions, such as relative responses of tall moss Polytrichum strictum Menzies ex Brid. and sphagna. We studied the effects of N deposition on growth, abundance, and CO2 exchange of the moss species Sphagnum capillifolium (Ehrh.) Hedw. and Polytrichum strictum in an experiment at a temperate bog. Sphagnum growth and cover decreased significantly with high-dose N treatment (6.4 g N$\cdot$m-2$\cdot$year-1) in years 4 and 5 of treatment, whereas the same parameters increased for Polytrichum compared with the control. Net CO2 exchange, gross photosynthesis (Pg), and dark respiration (R) in the intact moss cores, which were measured in year 5 of treatment, were elevated in the cores that had been treated with the high-dose of N, compared with the control, and this was associated with increased abundance of Polytrichum. The moss cores where Polytrichum was removed, however, had increased mass-based R with the high-dose N treatment. Our results showed that S. capillifolium at Mer Bleue may be close to N saturation, as 5 years of high-dose N loading (6.4 g N$\cdot$m-2$\cdot$year-1 + background) was harmful to this species, possibly as a result of increased respiratory cost. Polytrichum strictum had a competitive advantage, at least in the short-term, through allocating excess N to growth. This change in moss layer composition deserves further attention, as a shift to more easily decomposable litter, without corresponding increases in plant production, could reduce the carbon sequestration of the bog.},

  abstract = {Elevated nitrogen (N) deposition changes the retention, transformation, and fluxes of N in ombrotrophic peatlands. To evaluate such effects we applied a 15N tracer (NH4 15NO3) at a rate of 2.3 g N m-2 yr-1 to mesocosms of five European peatlands with differing long-term N deposition rates for a period of 76 days of dry and 90 days of wet conditions. We determined background N content and moss length growth, and recovered the 15N tracer from the mosses, graminoids, shrubs, the peat, and dissolved N. Background N contents in Sphagnum mosses increased from 5.5 (Deger{\"o} Stormyr, deposition $<$ 0.2 g N m-2 yr-1) up to 12.2 mg g-1 (Fr{\"o}lichshaier Sattelmoor, 4.7\textendash{}6.0 g N m-2 yr-1). In peat from Deger{\"o}, nitrate and ammonium concentrations were below 3 mg L-1, whereas up to 30 (nitrate) and 11 mg L-1 (ammonium) was found in peat from Fr{\"o}lichshaier Sattelmoor. Sphagnum mosses (down to 5 cm below surface) generally intercepted large amounts of 15N (0.2\textendash{}0.35 mg g-1) and retained the tracer most effectively relative to their biomass. Similar quantities of the 15N were recovered from the peat, followed by shrubs, graminoids, and the dissolved pool. At the most polluted sites we recovered more 15N from shrubs (up to 12.4 \%) and from nitrate and ammonium (up to 0.7 \%). However, no impact of N deposition on 15N retention by Sphagnum could be identified and their length growth was highest under high N background deposition. Our experiment suggests that the decline in N retention at levels above ca. 1.5 g m-2 yr-1, as expressed by elevated near-surface peat N content and increased dissolved N concentrations, is likely more modest than previously thought. This conclusion is related to the finding that Sphagnum species can apparently thrive at elevated long-term N deposition rates in European peatlands.},

in hummocks and lawn communities. Sphagnum biomass production decreased with increasing N influx in both
areas. After the first season at the low-deposition site, Sphagnum showed an increased growth in length with the
intermediate N treatment, but in the second and third seasons the control treatment had the highest growth in
length. Capitulum dry mass increased with increasing N influx. Sphagnum N concentration and N/P quotient
were higher at the high- than at the low-deposition site. The low quotient at the low-deposition site, together with
the initial growth increase with intermediate N supplements, indicates that growth was N-limited at this site, but
our lowest N supplement was sufficient to reduce growth. The N treatments had no effect on interspecific
competition between the Sphagnum species. This indicates that the species have similar responses to N. The
species studied all occur naturally on ombrotrophic, N-poor sites and show low tolerances to increased N influx.
Reduced Sphagnum production may affect the carbon balance, changing the mires from C sinks to sources.},

The bog is located in the zone with the highest atmospheric nitrogen deposition for Canada, estimated at 0.8\textendash{}1.2~g~N~m-2~yr-1 (wet deposition as NH4 and NO3). To establish the effect of nutrient addition on this ecosystem, we fertilized the bog with six treatments involving the application of 1.6\textendash{}6~g~N~m-2~yr-1 (as NH4NO3), with and without P and K, in triplicate 3~m \texttimes{} 3~m plots. The initial 5\textendash{}6 years have shown a loss of first Sphagnum, then Polytrichum mosses, and an increase in vascular plant biomass and leaf area index. Analyses of NEE, measured in situ with climate-controlled chambers, indicate that contrary to expectations, the treatments with the highest levels of nutrient addition showed lower rates of maximum NEE and gross photosynthesis, but little change in ecosystem respiration after 5 years. Although shrub biomass and leaf area increased in the high nutrient plots, loss of moss photosynthesis owing to nutrient toxicity, increased vascular plant shading and greater litter accumulation contributed to the lower levels of CO2 uptake. Our study highlights the importance of long-term experiments as we did not observe lower NEE until the fifth year of the experiment. However, this may be a transient response as the treatment plots continue to change. Higher levels of nutrients may cause changes in plant composition and productivity and decrease the ability of peatlands to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere.},

The impact of nitrogen (N) on vegetation composition of the Mer Bleue Bog (Ontario) and the underlying mechanisms were studied using a coupled carbon (C) and nitrogen wetland model (PEATBOG). The model was applied to data from a long-term nutrient fertilization experiment and the results were compared with the observed C and N pools in plants, peat, and soil water after 8 years of fertilization with 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 gN m-2 y-1 and additional phosphorus and potassium. The evaluated model was employed to simulate the vegetation dynamics in the peatland fertilized with different loads and concentrations of N. The model suggested a shift in plant functional types from moss-shrub dominated to graminoid dominated with increasing N load. Suppression of mosses by N fertilization was mitigated by daily deposition of N at a low concentration. Mosses became extinct in the simulations only when the concentration and load of N deposition were high, corroborating empirical results from the fertilization experiment. Tracking the deposited N in the system, the model indicated that it was primarily sequestered in the peat. Dissolved N concentrations in peat and export from the bog increased with N load and decreased with N concentration, leading to higher N uptake by vascular plants. The results further suggested that the observed detrimental effect of N on mosses was most likely due to toxicity caused by N uptake exceeding N assimilation. Exposure of mosses to high N concentrations in precipitation and evaporating water on moss tissues is thus a factor that needs attention when considering critical loads of N deposition on peatlands.},

  abstract = {Questions:  Is vegetation composition of ombrotrophic bogs with an undisturbed water regime resistant or sensitive to ongoing high atmospheric deposition and climatic changes? Location:  The Sudeten Mountains (Czech Republic). Methods:  Species composition of bryophytes and vascular plants was sampled in 25 permanent plots in suboceanic bogs of the Jizersk{\'e} hory Mountains and in 26 permanent plots in subcontinental bogs of the Hrub{\'y} Jesen{\'\i}k Mountains. The permanent plots were established and first sampled in 1991. These plots were re-sampled after 14 and 17 years, respectively. We also used historical vegetation plots (1947\textendash{}1949; 1980) from the same localities in order to reveal possible changes that might start earlier. Water chemistry was analysed annually, usually three times a year. Compositional changes were analysed by PERMANOVA, $\beta$-diversity changes by PERMDISP and other changes by t-test and Fisher's exact test. Results:  At the community level, no statistically significant changes were detected in permanent plots (PERMANOVA, PERMDISP), either in hollows or in hummocks, but the vegetation composition changed between the oldest (historical) and the newest data sets. At the level of functional groups, cover of Cyperaceae significantly decreased and cover of other herbs (excluding graminoids) and Sphagna increased in the Hrub{\'y} Jesen{\'\i}k Mountains, whereas no changes were detected in the Jizersk{\'e} hory Mountains. Cover of ericoid dwarf shrubs has not changed in either area. At the level of particular species, the frequency of Sphagnum magellanicum, Carex limosa, Scheuchzeria palustris and Vaccinium myrtillus decreased, while the frequency of Straminergon stramineum, Sphagnum recurvum agg., Eriophorum angustifolium and Luzula sylvatica increased. These changes were more evident when recent and historical data were compared. Conclusions:  When water regime is not affected, the bog vegetation seems to be rather resistant to high atmospheric deposition and climate fluctuation. A significant change of the species composition occurs only in the long-term perspective. Particular species could, however, decrease or increase their frequencies more rapidly. For some of these species a positive or negative response to nitrogen availability was also found in other studies, whereas for other species further research is needed in order to separate the effects of atmospheric deposition and internal ecosystem dynamics.},

It is unclear how C accumulation in peatlands responds to changing temperatures and nutrients (specifically, nitrogen and sulfur). In this study, we assessed how the C input rate and C accumulation rate in decadal old peat layers respond to increased air temperatures (+3.6$^\circ$C) during the growing season and the annual additions of nitrogen (N) and sulfur (S) (30 and 20\,kg\,ha-1\,yr-1, respectively) over 12\,years of field treatments in a boreal mire. An empirical mass balance model was applied to 210Pb-dated peat cores to evaluate changes in C inputs, C mass loss, and net C accumulation rates in response to the treatments. We found that (i) none of the treatments generated a significant effect on peat mass loss decay rates, (ii) C input rates were positively affected by N additions and negatively affected by S additions, (iii) the C accumulation rate in the uppermost (10 to 12\,cm) peat was increased by N additions and decreased by S additions, and (iv) only air temperature significantly affected the main effects induced by N and S additions. Based on our findings, we argue that C accumulation rates in surface peat layers of nutrient-poor boreal mires can increase despite the predicted rise in air temperatures as long as N loads increase and acid atmospheric S remains low.},

Gross photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration, and net CO2 exchange were measured weekly during May\textendash{}September 2011 using climate-controlled chambers. A substrate-induced respiration technique was used to determine the functional ability of the microbial community. The highest N and NPK additions were associated with 40\% less net CO2 uptake than the control. In the NPK additions, a diminished C sink potential was due to a 20\textendash{}30\% increase in ecosystem respiration, while gross photosynthesis rates did not change as greater vascular plant biomass compensated for the decrease in Sphagnum mosses. In the highest N-only treatment, small reductions in gross photosynthesis and no change in ecosystem respiration led to the reduced C sink. Substrate-induced microbial respiration was significantly higher in all levels of NPK additions compared with control. The temperature sensitivity of respiration in the plots was lower with increasing cumulative N load, suggesting more labile sources of respired CO2. The weaker C sink potential could be explained by changes in nutrient availability, higher woody~:~foliar ratio, moss loss, and enhanced decomposition. Stronger responses to NPK fertilization than to N-only fertilization for both shrub biomass production and decomposition suggest that the bog ecosystem is N-P/K colimited rather than N-limited. Negative effects of further N-only deposition were indicated by delayed spring CO2 uptake. In contrast to forests, increased wood formation and surface litter accumulation in bogs seem to reduce the C sink potential owing to the loss of peat-forming Sphagnum.},

Our aim is to study how vegetation changes, induced by nutrient input, affect the CO2 exchange of a nutrient-limited bog. We conducted 9- and 4-year fertilization experiments at Mer Bleue bog, where we applied N addition levels of 1.6, 3.2, and 6.4 g N m-2 a-1, upon a background deposition of about 0.8 g N m-2 a-1, with or without phosphorus and potassium (PK). Only the treatments 3.2 and 6.4 g N m-2 a-1 with PK significantly affected CO2 fluxes. These treatments shifted the Sphagnum moss and dwarf shrub community to taller dwarf shrub thickets without moss, and the CO2 responses depended on the phase of vegetation transition. Overall, compared to the large observed changes in the vegetation, the changes in CO2 fluxes were small. Following Sphagnum loss after 5 years, maximum ecosystem photosynthesis (Pgmax) and net CO2 exchange (NEEmax) were lowered (-19 and -46\%, respectively) in the highest NPK treatment. In the following years, while shrub height increased, the vascular foliar biomass did not fully compensate for the loss of moss biomass; yet, by year 8 there were no significant differences in Pgmax and NEEmax between the nutrient and the control treatments. At the same time, an increase (24\textendash{}32\%) in ecosystem respiration (ER) became evident. Trends in the N-only experiment resembled those in the older NPK experiment by the fourth year. The increasing ER with increasing vascular plant and decreasing Sphagnum moss biomass across the experimental plots suggest that high N deposition may lessen the CO2 sink of a bog.},

  abstract = {In this paper we report new data on peat carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) concentrations and accumulation rates for 15 sites in the UK. Concentrations of C, N and P measured in peat fromfive ombrotrophic blanket mires, spanning 4000-10,000 years to present were combined with existing nutrient data from ten Scottish ombrotrophic peat bogs to provide the first UK perspective on millennial scale macronutrient concentrations in ombrotrophic peats. Long-term average C, N and P concentrations (0-1.25 m) for the UK are 54.8, 1.56 and 0.039 wt\%, of similar magnitude to the few published comparable sites worldwide. The uppermost peat (0-0.2 m) is enriched in P and N (51.0, 1.86, and 0.070 wt\%) relative to the deeper peat (0.5-1.25 m, 56.3, 1.39, and 0.027 wt\%). Long-termaverage (whole core) accumulation rates of C, N and P are 25.3 +/- 2.2 gCm(-2) year(-1) (mean +/- SE), 0.70 +/- 0.09 gN m(-2) year(-1) and 0.018 +/- 0.004 gP m(-2) year(-1), again similar to values reported elsewhere in the world. The two most significant findings are: 1) that a regression model of N concentration on P concentration and mean annual precipitation, based on global meta data for surface peat samples, can explain 54\% of variance in N concentration in these UK peat profiles; and 2) budget calculations for the UK peat cores yield an estimate for long-term average N-fixation of 0.8 g m(-2) year(-1). Our UK results, and comparison with others sites, corroborate published estimates of N storage in northern boreal peatlands through the Holocene as ranging between 8 and 15 Pg N. However, the observed correlation of N\% with both mean annual precipitation and P concentration allows a potential bias in global estimates that do not take this into account.

  abstract = {Experimental studies have shown that deposition of reactive nitrogen is an important driver of plant community change, however, most of these experiments are of short duration with unrealistic treatments, and conducted in regions with elevated ambient deposition. Studies of spatial gradients of pollution can complement experimental data and indicate whether the potential impacts demonstrated by experiments are actually occurring in the `real world'. However, targeted surveys exist for only a very few habitats and are not readily comparable. In a coordinated campaign, we determined the species richness and plant community composition of five widespread, semi-natural habitats across Great Britain in sites stratified along gradients of climate and pollution, and related these ecological parameters to major drivers of biodiversity, including climate, pollution deposition, and local edaphic factors. In every habitat, we found reduced species richness and changed species composition associated with higher nitrogen deposition, with remarkable consistency in relative species loss across ecosystem types. Whereas the diversity of mosses, lichens, forbs, and graminoids declines with N deposition in different habitats, the cover of graminoids generally increases. Considered alongside previous experimental studies and survey work, our results provide a compelling argument that nitrogen deposition is a widespread and pervasive threat to terrestrial ecosystems.},

Conclusions 62 Acknowledgements 62 References 62 Summary Mosses in northern ecosystems are ubiquitous components of plant communities, and strongly influence nutrient, carbon and water cycling. We use literature review, synthesis and model simulations to explore the role of mosses in ecological stability and resilience. Moss community responses to disturbance showed all possible responses (increases, decreases, no change) within most disturbance categories. Simulations from two process-based models suggest that northern ecosystems would need to experience extreme perturbation before mosses were eliminated. But simulations with two other models suggest that loss of moss will reduce soil carbon accumulation primarily by influencing decomposition rates and soil nitrogen availability. It seems clear that mosses need to be incorporated into models as one or more plant functional types, but more empirical work is needed to determine how to best aggregate species. We highlight several issues that have not been adequately explored in moss communities, such as functional redundancy and singularity, relationships between response and effect traits, and parameter vs conceptual uncertainty in models. Mosses play an important role in several ecosystem processes that play out over centuries permafrost formation and thaw, peat accumulation, development of microtopography and there is a need for studies that increase our understanding of slow, long-term dynamical processes.},

  abstract = {Sphagnum-bog ecosystems have a limited capability to retain carbon and nutrients when subjected to increased nitrogen (N) deposition. Although it has been proposed that phosphorus (P) can dilute negative effects of nitrogen by increasing biomass production of Sphagnum mosses, it is still unclear whether P-addition can alleviate physiological N-stress in Sphagnum plants. A 3-year fertilisation experiment was conducted in lawns of a pristine Sphagnum magellanicum bog in Patagonia, where competing vascular plants were practically absent. Background wet deposition of nitrogen was low (similar to 0.10.2 g.N.m-2.year-1). Nitrogen (4 g.N.m-2.year-1) and phosphorus (1 g.P.m-2.year-1) were applied, separately and in combination, six times during the growing season. P-addition substantially increased biomass production of Sphagnum. Nitrogen and phosphorus changed the morphology of Sphagnum mosses by enhancing height increment, but lowering moss stem density. In contrast to expectations, phosphorus failed to alleviate physiological stress imposed by excess nitrogen (e.g. amino acid accumulation, N-saturation and decline in photosynthetic rates). We conclude that despite improving growth conditions by P-addition, Sphagnum-bog ecosystems remain highly susceptible to nitrogen additions. Increased susceptibility to desiccation by nutrients may even worsen the negative effects of excess nitrogen especially in windy climates like in Patagonia.},

  abstract = {1. Bogs are nutrient-poor peatland ecosystems that are sensitive to nitrogen (N) deposition. Production of peat mosses (i.e. the peat-forming genus Sphagnum) is known to decrease under elevated N deposition, but the causal mechanisms are poorly understood. 2. It is predicted that increased N deposition will cause changes in Sphagnum species composition, with fast-growing species benefiting from increased N availability in contrast to slow-growing species. Knowledge of species-specific responses to N availability can help us to understand interspecific competitive relationships. 3. We investigated the direct effects of N application on plant physiology in three Sphagnum species by exposing shoots to a range of N doses (corresponding to depositions of 0-5 6 g m) 2 year) 1), over 5 months, in a greenhouse experiment. The species investigated included one that grows high above the water-table (Sphagnum fuscum) and two that grow lower down (Sphagnum balticum and Sphagnum fallax). S. fuscum and S. balticum originate from ombrotrophic and S. fallax from minerotrophic environments. To estimate N responses, we measured the performance and light-capture kinetics of the photosynthetic apparatus (maximum photosynthetic rate and Fv/Fm), biomass production, shoot formation, and N and phosphorus (P) concentrations in the tissue. 4. Tissue nitrogen concentration generally increased with N application rate, and photosynthetic rate increased with N concentration, although S. balticum exhibited a unimodal response. With respect to production, a negative response to N application rate was found in S. fallax and S. fuscum (weak), while production in S. balticum was unrelated to application rate. S. fallax was the fastest-growing species, producing two to three times more biomass per shoot compared with the other species. 5. The mismatch between photosynthetic capacity and production could partly be explained by an increased N : P ratio following N application. Phosphorus limitation may not negatively affect photosynthetic capacity, but may hamper production. 6. The fast-growing species S. fallax is considered to benefit from increased N deposition, but we found a negative physiological response, suggesting stoichiometric constraints. Thus, we conclude that responses to N deposition cannot be predicted in a simple way from physiological traits related to growth rate without considering local environmental factors.},

  abstract = {Aim Elevated inputs of biologically reactive nitrogen (N) are considered to be one of the most substantial threats to biodiversity in terrestrial ecosystems. Several attempts have been made to scrutinize the factors driving species loss following excess N input, but generalizations across sites or vegetation types cannot yet be made. Here we focus on the relative importance of the vegetation type, the local environment (climate, soil pH, wet deposition load) and the experimentally applied (cumulative) N dose on the response of the vegetation to N addition. Location Mainly North America and Europe. Methods We conducted a large-scale meta-analysis of in situ N addition experiments in different vegetation types, focusing on the response of biomass and species richness. Results Whereas the biomass of grasslands and salt marshes significantly increased with N fertilization, forest understorey vegetation, heathlands, freshwater wetlands and bogs did not show any significant response. Graminoids significantly increased in biomass following N addition, whereas bryophytes significantly lost biomass; shrubs, forbs and lichens did not significantly respond. The yearly N fertilization dose significantly influenced the biomass response of grassland and salt marshes, while for the other vegetation types none of the collected predictor variables were of significant influence. Species richness significantly decreased with N addition in grasslands and heathlands [Correction added on 23 March 2011, after first online publication: `across all vegetation types' changed to `in grasslands and heathlands']. The relative change in species richness following N addition was significantly driven by the cumulative N dose. Main conclusions The decline in species richness with cumulative N input follows a negative exponential pathway. Species loss occurs faster at low levels of cumulative N input or at the beginning of the addition, followed by an increasingly slower species loss at higher cumulative N inputs. These findings lead us to stress the importance of including the cumulative effect of N additions in calculations of critical load values.},

  abstract = {Peatlands occupy a relatively small fraction of the Earth's land area, but they are a globally important carbon store because of their high carbon density. Undisturbed peatlands are currently a weak carbon sink (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a moderate source of methane (CH4; similar to 0.03 Pg CH4 y(-1)), and a very weak source of nitrous oxide (N2O; similar to 0.00002 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). Anthropogenic disturbance, primarily agriculture and forestry drainage (10\%-20\% of global peatlands), results in net CO2 emissions, reduced CH4 emissions, and increased N2O emissions. This likely changes the global peatland greenhouse gas balance to a C source (similar to 0.1 Pg C y(-1)), a 10\% smaller CH4 source, and a larger (but still small) N2O source (similar to 0.0004 Pg N2O-N y(-1)). There is no strong evidence that peatlands significantly contributed to 20th century changes in the atmospheric burden of CO2, CH4, or N2O; will this picture change in the 21st century? A review of experimental and observational studies of peatland dynamics indicates that the main global change impacts on peatlands that may have significant climate impacts are (1) drainage, especially in the tropics; (2) widespread permafrost thaw; and (3) increased fire intensity and frequency as a result of drier climatic conditions and (or) drainage. Quantitative estimates of global change impacts are limited by the sparse field data (particularly in the tropics), the large variability present in existing data, uncertainties in the future trajectory of peatland use, interactive effects of individual impacts, and the unprecedented rates of climate change expected in the 21st century.},

  abstract = {Although numerous studies have addressed the effects of increased N deposition on nutrient-poor environments such as raised bogs, few studies have dealt with to what extent, and on what time-scale, reductions in atmospheric N supply would lead to recovery of the ecosystems in question. Since a considerable part of the negative effects of elevated N deposition on raised bogs can be related to an imbalance in tissue nutrient concentrations of the dominant peat-former Sphagnum, changes in Sphagnum nutrient concentration after excess N supply may be used as an early indicator of ecosystem response. This study focuses on the N and P concentrations of Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum fallax before, during and after a factorial fertilization experiment with N and P in two small peatlands subject to a background bulk deposition of 2 g N m(-2) year(-1). Three years of adding N (4.0 g N m(-2) year(-1)) increased the N concentration, and adding P (0.3 g P m(-2) year(-1)) increased the P concentration in Sphagnum relative to the control treatment at both sites. Fifteen months after the nutrient additions had ceased, N concentrations were similar to the control whereas P concentrations, although strongly reduced, were still slightly elevated. The changes in the N and P concentrations were accompanied by changes in the distribution of nutrients over the capitulum and the stem and were congruent with changes in translocation. Adding N reduced the stem P concentration, whereas adding P reduced the stem N concentration in favor of the capitulum. Sphagnum nutrient concentrations quickly respond to reductions in excess nutrient supply, indicating that a management policy aimed at reducing atmospheric nutrient input to bogs can yield results within a few years.},

We performed a greenhouse experiment to study the effects of two temperature treatments (17.5 and 21.7$^\circ$C) and two N addition treatments (0 and 4 g N m-2 year-1) on the growth of four Sphagnum species from three geographically interspersed regions: S. fuscum, S. balticum (northern and central Sweden), S. magellanicum and S. cuspidatum (southern Sweden). We studied the growth and cover change in four combinations of these Sphagnum species during two growing seasons. Sphagnum height increment and production were affected negatively by high temperature and high N addition. However, the northern species were more affected by temperature, while the southern species were more affected by N addition. High temperature depressed the cover of the `wet' species, S. balticum and S. cuspidatum. Nitrogen concentrations increased with high N addition. N:P and N:K ratios indicated P-limited growth in all treatments and co-limitation of P and K in the high N treatments. In the second year of the experiment, several containers suffered from a severe fungal infection, particularly affecting the `wet' species and the high N treatment. Our findings suggest that global change can have negative consequences for the production of Sphagnum species in bogs, with important implications for the carbon sequestration in these ecosystems.},

Pollutants and climate changes resulting from human activity are likely to affect the processes controlling methane emissions from these systems. This study investigated the effects of decadal deposition of nitrogen and sulfate, and increased air temperature, on methane emissions from a northern Swedish peatland during the snow-free seasons of 2005 and 2006, the latter being exceptionally dry. The experimental setup involved a full factorial design at two levels with greenhouse cover (present or absent), nitrogen deposition (2 or 30 kg N ha-1 a-1), and sulfate deposition (3 or 20 kg S ha-1 a-1) as experimental factors. Methane emission rates were measured using static chambers after 10\textendash{}11 years of experimental manipulations. Emissions were significantly reduced by the greenhouse treatment in 2005, by 30\% on average, but not in 2006. The reduction in methane emissions in response to the greenhouse treatment were counteracted by nitrogen deposition; with high nitrogen deposition the effect of the greenhouse cover was low and nonsignificant. High nitrogen deposition increased methane emissions at ambient sulfate levels, probably due to sedge cover increasing from 37 to 65\%, but the combination of high nitrogen deposition and high sulfate deposition did not affect methane emissions. Effects of increased nitrogen on methane emission have previously in short-term manipulations ($<$6 years) been ranging from slightly negative to slightly positive. The substantial positive effects observed in this study emphasize the need for long-term manipulations to obtain valid results under natural conditions.},

  abstract = {Increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere or continuous nitrogen (N) deposition might alter the carbon (C) cycle in boreal mires and thus have significant impacts on the development of climate change. The atmospheric impact of the C cycle in mires is twofold: C accumulation attenuates and CH4 release strengthens the natural greenhouse effect. We studied the effects of an increased supply of CO2 or NH4NO3 on the vegetation and annual CO2 exchange in lawns of a boreal oligotrophic mire in eastern Finland over a 2-year period. Ten study plots were enclosed with mini-FACE (Free Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment) rings. Five plots were vented with CO2-enriched air (target 560 ppmv), while their controls were vented with ambient air; five plots were sprayed with NH4NO3, corresponding to a cumulative addition of 3 g N m-2 a-1, while their controls were sprayed with distilled water only. A raised NH4NO3 supply seemed to affect the composition of the moss layer. Raised CO2 did not affect the vegetation, but gross photosynthesis increased significantly. The change in net CO2 exchange depended on the annual weather conditions. Our results suggest that C accumulation may increase in wet years and compensate for the warming effect caused by the increase in CH4 release from this mire. In contrast, a relatively dry and warm growing period favors decomposition and can even make the CO2 balance negative. Along with the increased CH4 release under raised CO2, the decreased C accumulation then increases the radiative forcing of boreal mires.},

  abstract = {The aim of this study was to detect vegetation change and to examine trophic interactions in a Sphagnum-dominated mire in response to raised temperature and nitrogen (N) addition. A long-term global-change experiment was established in 1995, with monthly additions of N (30 kg$\cdot$ha-1$\cdot$yr-1) and sulfur (20 kg$\cdot$ha-1$\cdot$yr-1) during the vegetation period. Mean air temperature was raised by 3.6$^\circ$C with warming chambers. Vegetation responses were negligible for all treatments for the first four years, and no sulfur effect was seen during the course of the experiment. However, after eight years of continuous treatments, the closed Sphagnum carpet was drastically reduced from 100\% in 1995 down to 41\%, averaged over all N-treated plots. Over the same period, total vascular plant cover (of the graminoid Eriophorum vaginatum and the two dwarf-shrubs Andromeda polifolia and Vaccinium oxycoccos) increased from 24\% to an average of 70\% in the N plots. Nitrogen addition caused leaf N concentrations to rise in the two dwarf-shrubs, while for E. vaginatum, leaf N remained unchanged, indicating that the graminoid to a larger extent than the dwarf-shrubs allocated supplemented N to growth. Concurrent with foliar N accumulation of the two dwarf-shrubs, we observed increased disease incidences caused by parasitic fungi, with three species out of 16 showing a significant increase. Warming caused a significant decrease in occurrence of three parasitic fungal species. In general, decreased disease incidences were found in temperature treatments for A. polifolia and in plots without N addition for V. oxycoccos. The study demonstrates that both bryophytes and vascular plants at boreal mires, only receiving background levels of nitrogen of about 2 kg$\cdot$ha-1$\cdot$yr-1, exhibit a time lag of more than five years in response to nitrogen and temperature rise, emphasizing the need for long-term experiments. Moreover, it shows that trophic interactions are likely to differ markedly in response to climate change and increased N deposition, and that these interactions might play an important role in controlling the change in mire vegetation composition, with implications for both carbon sequestration and methane emission.},

  abstract = {Oligotrophic, Sphagnum-dominated peatlands have been regarded as long-term stable ecosystems that function as carbon sinks. As a result of environmental perturbations, particularly anthropogenic N deposition, this view is now increasingly questioned. We examined whether small-scale field experiments can predict the direction and magnitude of ecosystem responses to increased N supply. We, therefore, compared data from a 10-year field experiment (involving deposition of 2, 15 and 30 kg N ha-1 year-1) with data from a gradient associated with increased N deposition (2, 8 and 12 kg N ha-1 year-1). We chose to compare: (1) the physiological response of Sphagnumbalticum, measured in the form of N accumulation as free amino acids (NAA); and (2) changes in the total Sphagnum cover, the cover of S. balticum, and vascular plant cover. In all cases we found a highly significant correlation between the two data sets. We attribute the high correspondence between the two data sets to the key function of the dominant group of organisms, the Sphagna, that monopolize N availability and control the water balance, creating an environment hostile to vascular plants. Thus the key role of Sphagna as ecosystem engineers seems to supersede the role of other, scale-dependent processes. We also conclude that NAA is a sensitive indicator that can be used to signal the slow and gradual shift from Sphagnum to vascular plant dominance.},

  abstract = {Nitrogen (N) pollution of peatlands alters their carbon (C) balances, yet long-term effects and controls are poorly understood. We applied the model PEATBOG to explore impacts of long-term nitrogen (N) fertilization on C cycling in an ombrotrophic bog. Simulations of summer gross ecosystem production (GEP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were evaluated against 8 years of observations and extrapolated for 80 years to identify potential effects of N fertilization and factors influencing model behaviour. The model successfully simulated moss decline and raised GEP, ER and NEE on fertilized plots. GEP was systematically overestimated in the model compared to the field data due to factors that can be related to differences in vegetation distribution (e.g. shrubs vs. graminoid vegetation) and to high tolerance of vascular plants to N deposition in the model. Model performance regarding the 8-year response of GEP and NEE to N input was improved by introducing an N content threshold shifting the response of photosynthetic capacity (GEPmax) to N content in shrubs and graminoids from positive to negative at high N contents. Such changes also eliminated the competitive advantages of vascular species and led to resilience of mosses in the long-term. Regardless of the large changes of C fluxes over the short-term, the simulated GEP, ER and NEE after 80 years depended on whether a graminoid- or shrub-dominated system evolved. When the peatland remained shrub\textendash{}Sphagnum-dominated, it shifted to a C source after only 10 years of fertilization at 6.4 g N m-2 yr-1, whereas this was not the case when it became graminoid-dominated. The modelling results thus highlight the importance of ecosystem adaptation and reaction of plant functional types to N deposition, when predicting the future C balance of N-polluted cool temperate bogs.},

  abstract = {Ecosystems are subject to multiple, natural and anthropogenic environmental influences, including nitrogen (N) deposition, land use and climate. Assessment of the relative importance of these influences on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning is crucial for guiding policy and management decisions to mitigate global change; yet, few studies consider multiple drivers. In the UK, ongoing loss of the internationally important arctic/alpine moss-sedge community, Racomitrium heath, has been linked to elevated N deposition, high grazing pressures and their combination; however, the relative importance of these drivers remains unclear. We used environmental gradients across the habitat's European distribution (UK, Faroes, Norway and Iceland) to investigate the relative impact of N deposition and grazing pressure, as well as climate, on the condition of the dominant moss species, Racomitrium lanuginosum. Key variables including tissue chemistry, growth and cover were measured at 36 sites, and multiple linear regressions were used to examine the relative importance of the drivers across sites. Our results clearly show that regional variation in the condition of R. lanuginosum across Europe is primarily associated with the impacts of N deposition, with climate (air temperature) and grazing pressure playing secondary roles. In contrast to previous experimental studies, we found moss growth to be stimulated by elevated N deposition; this apparent discrepancy may result from the use of artificially high N concentrations in many experiments. Despite increased growth rates, we found that moss mat depth and cover declined in response to N deposition. Our results suggest that this is due to increased decomposition of material in the moss mat, which ultimately leads to loss of moss cover and habitat degradation. This study clearly demonstrates both the key role of N deposition in degradation of Racomitrium heath and the importance of observational studies along natural gradients for testing predictions from experimental studies in the real world.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition is a global and increasing threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function. Much of our current understanding of N deposition impacts comes from field manipulation studies, although interpretation may need caution where simulations of N deposition (in terms of dose, application rate and N form) have limited realism. Here, we review responses to simulated N deposition from the UKREATE network, a group of nine experimental sites across the UK in a diversity of heathland, grassland, bog and dune ecosystems which include studies with a high level of realism and where many are also the longest running globally on their ecosystem type. Clear responses were seen across the sites with the greatest sensitivity shown in cover and species richness of bryophytes and lichens. Productivity was also increased at sites where N was the limiting nutrient, while flowering also showed high sensitivity, with increases and declines seen in dominant shrub and forb species, respectively. Critically, these parameters were responsive to some of the lowest additional loadings of N (7.7\textendash{}10~kg~ha-1~yr-1) showing potential for impacts by deposition rates seen in even remote and `unpolluted' regions of Europe. Other parameters were less sensitive, but nevertheless showed response to higher doses. These included increases in soil \%N and `plant available' KCl extractable N, N cycling rates and acid\textendash{}base status. Furthermore, an analysis of accumulated dose that quantified response against the total N input over time suggested that N impacts can `build up' within an ecosystem such that even relatively low N deposition rates can result in ecological responses if continued for long enough. Given the responses have important implications for ecosystem structure, function, and recovery from N loading, the clear evidence for impacts at relatively low N deposition rates across a wide range of habitats is of considerable concern.},
